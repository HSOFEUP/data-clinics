If you hover your mouse on the data points you can see the corresponding value of y- and x-axis and the genre this point belongs to. By clicking on a genre in the legend you can clear it from the plot, the second click will make it appear again. Zooming in and out is also possible using the options in top-right corner of every plot. This tool allows for better inspection of the graph."

    "* Fantasy was very unstable, peak in 1982 and since then a steady decrease. \n",
    "* Western quite popular before 80s. \n",
    "* History continuously dropping until leveling out in mid-80s. Documentary sky-rocketing since 90s. \n",

    "* I don't see any ethical concerns regarding this dataset\n",
    "* The biggest issue of the dataset is that most of values in `budget` and `revenue` are missing which decreases reliability of our analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 Main findings\n",
    "* The most profitable movies are released around June and December\n",
    "* Revenue, budget and number of votes are strongly correlated (nothing surprising)\n",
    "* Revenue and production per year keeps dramatically increasing years after years\n",
    "* Using our measure of success (relative income*rating), there is no correlation between time and success\n",
    "* Drama is the most popular movie genre and has been for almost every year for the past five decades\n",

    "### 7.3. Future work & interesting directions (aka what I would do if I had more time and patience)\n",
    "* Relate the trends in genres (especially those from the last plot) with contemporary sociopolitical situation and also some classic movies and verify if the data shows their influence - for example how Star Wars impacted Science Fiction.\n",
    "* Investigate actor chemistry - which groups of actors lead to the best movies. Directors often have favourite actors that they like to work with. For example, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth and a few other actors frequently star in Tarantino movies. \n",
    "* Are movies in series on average earning more than single films?"
