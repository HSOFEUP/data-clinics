    "About 10000 movies were fetched and parsed from [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) website. The \"bestness\" of these books came from a proprietary formula used by Goodreads and published as a list on their web site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrapping the data from the website, lead to a tabular format info file presented here as a CSV file. In this clinic we'll clean and further parse the data.  We'll then do some exploratory data analysis to answer questions about these best books and popular genres.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this clinic, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and systematically address missing values, encoded as `NaN` values in our data set, for example, by removing observations associated with these values.\n",
    "- Parse columns in the dataframe to create new dataframe columns.\n",
    "- Create and interpret visualizations to explore the data set\n",

    "Use your notebook to add any comments, results, code, etc. In the end, make sure that all cells are executed properly and everything you need to show is in your (execucted) notebook. You are asked to deliver **only your notebook file, .ipnyb** and nothing else. Enjoy!"

    "(Already discussed, repeated here).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic workflow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build** a DataFrame from the data (ideally, put all data in this object)\n",
    "2. **Clean** the DataFrame. It should have the following properties:\n",
    "    - Each row describes a single object\n",
    "    - Each column describes a property of that object\n",
    "    - Columns are numeric whenever appropriate\n",
    "    - Columns contain atomic properties that cannot be further decomposed\n",
    "3. Explore **global properties**. Use histograms, scatter plots, and aggregation functions to summarize the data.\n",
    "4. Explore **group properties**. Use groupby and small multiples to compare subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process transforms your data into a format which is easier to work with, gives you a basic overview of the data's properties, and likely generates several questions for you to followup in subsequent analysis."
