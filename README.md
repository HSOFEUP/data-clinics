# Data Analysis - assignments
This repository contains my assignments for the Data Analysis course that I attended in Spring 2020 as part of my bachelor's degree. It consists of three selected projects (called Data Clinics). Each folder contains a notebook with starter code (named "clinicX_StarterCode"), another notebook with my work ("ClinicX_BlazejDolicki") and corresponding data. Every  with my own work has a table of contents at the beginning which enables easy navigation between different sections.

## Clinic 1 - Data exploration of movies dataset
After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I perform a detailed exploratory data analysis accompanied by useful visualizations. Among other things, I examine how trends in different genders change over time, which movies are the most successful (using different metrics of sucess), how revenue and other features correlate with each other. 

## Clinic 3 - Classification in Python
In this notebook, I aim to classify if a person is in poor health or not. I compare multiple methods for filling missing values and some basic machine learning models (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and xgboost). I employ k-fold cross validation to evaluate those approaches.

## Clinic 4 - Time series analysis on COVID-19 data
At first, I conduct some general exploration, discuss limitations of the data. I visualize the spread rate for selected countries and investigate correlation between spread rate and population density. At the end I fit an ARIMA model using arguments selected based on ACF and PACF plots.
