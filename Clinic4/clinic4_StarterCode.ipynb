Define your \"day 0\" properly: If you look online, some people consider as day 0, either the day that the country reported the first infection, or the day that a cummulative amount of e.g. 50 infections were reported, or you might think of something else. The reason for this is to have a proper comparison metric for the timeseries of different countries.\n",

The real challenge here is that we don't have enough data points for having accurate train/test models, so you have to think of a work-around (e.g. fit model for a deep-in-the-outbreak-country like China and then try to see how that model performs on other countries).\n",

    "* As the situation evolves and since the clinic is delivered in one week, you can use \"real\" world data for testing! Make sure to download the data every day and check your model prediction.\n",
